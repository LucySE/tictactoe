# Tic-Tac-Toe

Project 0 was to create a working game of tic-tac-toe

## Link (to the live site)

Add a link to your demo here

## How it was built (Or you can call this Technologies Used)

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to build this game.

## How to play / Features

(Don't explain how to play tic-tac-toe, most people know. Explain or list out some features you've added. An example below)

You have been assigned the character 'Socks' and will take turns playing against the CPU - 'Boots'.

The game will track the number of games both you and the CPU has won. To reset the board and play again simply click the 'Reset' button (don't worry this won't clear the score count).

(YOU COULD ADD A SCREENSHOT HERE)

## Known Bugs

There are a couple of pieces to the puzzle to touch up before the project is complete such as the game enabling you to select a free space after either you or the CPU has won the game. This unfortunately also creates issues with the score count but I will be sure to fix this shortly!
