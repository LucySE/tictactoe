# Tic-Tac-Toe

Project 0 was to create a working game of tic-tac-toe

## Link (to the live site)

## How it was built (Or you can call this Technologies Used)

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to build this game.

## How to play / Features

We begin with player X and then O, however, in later releases, players will be able to upload there own pictures.

## Known Bugs

There are a couple of pieces to the puzzle to touch up before the project is complete such as the game enabling you to select a free space after either you or the CPU has won the game. This unfortunately also creates issues with the score count but I will be sure to fix this shortly!

## Future feature / Wishlist

- In future releases the game will evolve into a magic 8 ball feature.  

## My experience developing the game (Optional)
